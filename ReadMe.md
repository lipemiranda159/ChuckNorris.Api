# Chuck Norris Api

Welcome to Chuck Norris Api project.

## What?
In this project, we would like to have a RESTFul API that returns multiple Chuck Norris facts/jokes.
In doing so, it will also rename all the instances of `Chuck` to a shorter form `CH.` in the facts/jokes.

Currently, the code is written in a way that does not satisfy our standards of a production-ready code. 
Your job is to make any and all necessary changes to make this a production-ready project/solution.
It is all up to you as to how you'd like to modify and structure the new solution.

Here are some (but certainly not all) of the aspects of your code that we would like to see in the modified solution:
 * Code structure and organization
 * Architecture 
 * Design Patterns
 

**Disclaimer**: ==Though we had lots of fun writing this code, it does not reflect the conventions, style, and architecture of the code currently produced by our teams for our products.==

## How?

The jokes are being retrieved from the public API below, and the number of jokes to be returned is passed to the Api as an integer.
Then a helper class is making the required replacement of "Chuck" to "CH." before returning the jokes.

## Who?

This is a coding challenge for the candidates for a developer role. The candidates must complete their work within maximum of **4 hours**.
